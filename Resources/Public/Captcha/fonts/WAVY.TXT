The Wavy font is an all-caps display font in which all of the normally straight lines on the letters are slightly wavy.  It displays best at sizes of 18 points or more.

This font was created using Fontographer for Windows.  It is (c) 1994 by J. Fordyce but may be freely distributed provided it is not altered, no fee is charged for it, and this text file is included with it.
