Freeware Fonts Galore
(c)1997 by Astigmatic One Eye Fonts

You have just downloaded a Freeware Font created by Astigmatic One Eye Font Foundry.  Since November of '97 we have been striving to create more high quality fonts, sometimes serious, sometimes bizarre, always interesting, and atleast 1 new FREEWARE font EVERY MONTH!  Available for Macintosh and Windows PC in TrueType format.

Be sure to take the time to check out our fonts for sale, for without your support we will be unable to offer you our free fonts EVERY MONTH.  Any $10 font registration and purchase will get the full version of that particular font in whatever format best suits your needs, (Postscript, or TrueType.), and also a full copy of one of our special freebies with a purchase fonts, some of our freeware fonts, and trial versions of a few other shareware typefaces.  Be sure to check out our full variety of fonts, always growing.
