# Legacy JavaScript files

This folder still exists for backwards-compatibility with older
versions of the `seminars` and `onetimeaccount` extensions.

The complete folder will be removed in version 10.0.0. Please use the
corresponding files in `Resources/Public/JavaScript` instead.

The files in this folder also will not receive and updates or bug fixes
before they get removed.
